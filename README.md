- 👋 Hi, I’m Ossama, a doctoral researcher leveraging Large language models(LLMs)/Generative AI for physics based simulations.
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, maths, biology, physics and chemistry. Particularly Quantum physics/mechanics is a subject I am impressed by and continue to read/expand on it.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching LLMs(Large Language Models) and their applications to physics based simulations. I'm interested in finetuning techniques and RAG methodologies to help achieve solutions to modern problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scientific research within the domain of life sciences,engineering and computer science.
